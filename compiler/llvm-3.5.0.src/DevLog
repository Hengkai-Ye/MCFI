  We need to correlate each indirect call/jmp to its IR-level call/invoke. In
  the original MCFI toolchain implementation, we just assume that each machine
  instruction basic block can be mapped onto an IR basic block, and the orders
  of indirect calls and IR call/invoke are preserved by the LLVM backend.
  However, the assumption is probably problematic in the future.

  In the new implementation, we are seeking to modify the code generation logic
  to propagate IR level information directly to the machine code level.

  Each IR call/invoke instruction is lowered to machine call (in the DAG) in
  lib/Target/X86/X86ISelLowering.cpp: X86TargetLowring::LowerCall, line 2999

This directory contains the patches we made to compile and harden SPECCPU2006
C/C++ benchmarks using the MCFI tool chain.

*.patch: you can directly use these files to patch a vanilla benchmark program's
         src directory. Such files contain both the changes to compile and
         harden the program.

*.changes: these files document the changes we made to compile the benchmark
         programs with the libraries coming along with the tool chain.
